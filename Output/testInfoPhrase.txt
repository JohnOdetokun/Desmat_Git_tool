Message: Refactor documents to have no reliance on a processinstance, nor a single processinstance at that. Refactor DocumentApproval service into two email services to allow document uploads to email based on process instance. Write a processinstance index caller that uses the controllerresolver so that we can direct to any module from the generic document capture email. Start refactoring documentvalidationexceptions. Achieve successful build. re: #542, #591, #590, #589
